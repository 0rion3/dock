This software is free for all and it is allowed to use for personal, commercial
or other peaceful purposes. No link-backs are necessary. You're allowed to clone,
copy, modify and contribute to this project. It is provided as is with and
maintainers and/or contributors are not responsible for any damage it may does
(but the hope is that it actually does the opposite - good).


THINGS NOT CONCERNING LICENSING
-------------------------------
PLEASE CONSIDER leaving the "donation message" which is displayed to
users connecting to the container as is - especially when you distribute your
custom dock-compatible images. You are free to add or your own welcome message
or remove it completely, as it was decided not to prohibit this in the LICENCE.

    As the welcome message starts to annoy - by all means, disable it - all you
    have to do is add DISABLE_DOCK_WELCOME MESSAGE=1 into your ~/.dockrc file.


FORKING
-------
If you decide to fork the repository and publish it some place else, it would
be of great help if you kept the message, the original links the maintainer's
website and donation information without modifications. Your help in this regard
- not removing the donation info - would be greatly appreciated - not just
by the project maintainers, but by ordinary people too, as part of the money
donated to the project will be funneled to those in dire need of help.

See the official website at https://dock.orion3.space/donate for details.

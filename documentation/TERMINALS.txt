TERMINALS INTEGRATION
---------------------

When you connect to a container by typing `dock`, the script will attempt
to change your terminal theme (if you create one for it). It helps you see
that you're inside a container when your terminal changes theme and its
background becomes blue instead of black

Possibly some other terminal-related features can be added, apart from just
switching themes. But currently only the "Tilix" terminal is supported.
As more terminals support is added (I don't know which ones can do the same
thing, though), this file will be updated with appropriate instructions.

    STEPS TO INTEGRATE
    ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

    1. Go to Tilix Preferences -> Profiles and create a new profile
       called "Dockguest" that you'd like to be your default dock-themed profile.
       Then change any settings as you wish including the color scheme.

    2. Go to the "Advanced" tab of this profile and in the
       "Automatic profile switching" section click add, then
       enter "Dockguest:" - just like that, ending on ":".

    3. Try connecting to the container using the `dock` command
       and see that your theme had changed.

  You can create other themes too, as in fact, suggested by the ./dockrc.template
  file and assign each theme its own container name. If your container name
  containers dots "." as they frequently might if you create them with `dock`,
  you should replace dots with dashes "-" in ~/.dockrc.

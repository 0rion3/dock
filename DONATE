DONATIONS
---------

This project can do a lot of good - it already has done so, beyond what
I myself expected even. It saved me so much time over the past 1.5 years.
But apart from that, I would like to send a large portion of funds donated
to good causes, to people in dire need of help right now. If you're reading
this in plain text, please visit https://dock.orion3.space/donate.html for
a more detailed info on what the donations are going to be used for.

If you donate, feel free to email and request a feature, a bug fix or anything
else related. I can't guarantee it, but since I've been working on this software
and using it myself for over a year I do think there must be people like myself
out there, who would find this tool immensely helpful. It's not going to
suddenly stop working - especially because it's just Bash scripts. So every
feature or bugfix added stays there for years to come without much need for
maintenance.

  [1] Other crypto-currencies are accepted as well. Please email me and ask.
      See CONTACTING section for details.

  [2] Unfortunately, with the current situation in the world, it's becoming
      increasingly more difficult to receive donations via traditional
      payment systems, but feel free to email and discuss it. A bank transfer
      to a bank in a  neutral jurisdiction is theoritically possible too.

# This simply gives us a little bit of information about the current

# More importantly, because the default behavior is to mount $PWD
# into the /home/docker/main directory inside the container, current
# this simply copies the value of  puts $PWD into $project_path variable
# used in other scripts.

# I decided to make it a separate script as it doesn't actually belong
# to either ./container_info or ./image_info or ./project_info and
# the information it provides may or may not be used by either of them.

# Fetches and imports images for the user based on the image name provided in $1.
# An image name is actually an alias and one image may have plenty of aliases.
# Aliases are currently defined remotely in the file that this script fetches
# from the official website: https://dock.orion3.space/images.txt
#
# The take a look at that file, you'll see that you can install the same image
# by typing these commands:
#
#   $ ./get_image hub default
#   $ ./get_image hub ubuntu20
#   $ ./get_image hub dock:ubuntu20:latest
#
# When you take a look at the https://dock.orion3.space/images.txt,
# note that the last alias on the aliases be used to tag the image if
# the $source_name of the image is found under one of aliases
# in https://dock.orion3.space/images.txt (and if not - it will remain
# as is).
#
# To clarify:
#
#   * $image_name is the second positional argument, provided by the user,
#     basically it's one of the images aliases that go
#     on the first line of each image section in https://dock.orion3.space/images.txt
#
#   * $source_image_name is the name that's specified in the aliases line of the
#     each image section.
#
#   * $target_image_name is the name that the image will be re-tagged into
#     once imported. It may not change at all if $image_name alias isn't present
#     in the official https://dock.orion3.space/images.txt
#
#     So, this file doesn't actually limit what you can download, only makes
#     sure the official dock-compatible images are downloaded from correct
#     sources and re-tagged with correct names.

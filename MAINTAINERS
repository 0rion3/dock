Information for each contributor and/or maintainer will be published in this
file according to the specific preferences they might have. If someone doesn't
want to be contacted - then their contact information will not be published.

See ./CONTRIBUTE for the information on how you can contribute code, resources,
knowledge, funding or a number of other things to this project - since it's an
intentionally a self hosted repository, you'd have to contact one of the
maintainers.

    EMAIL

      Use the domain name of the project stripping "dock." from it and
      adding the maintainer's nickname before the @ sign.

          --> correct email you shall end up with contains the nickname twice.

      Messages currently go through Protonmail, so if you're also sending from
      Protonmail you don't have to bother and encrypt them manually.

      If you want to encrypt your message, but you do not have a Protonmail
      account you can encrypt your message with this maintainer's PGP public key.
      Be advised: this key is used ONLY for communication from the email
      specified above. IT IS NOT used for signing releases or any other number 
      of things PGP is employed for.
